Performs DP or double propagation of scalar data from grandchild nodes, for cases where grandchild has a 1:1 relationship with its parent. Requires SP (aka Single Propagation) process to have been run before hand. 

This program can only be used after the intial load of graph data. It cannot handle incremental dp updates - a separate program will be developed for this purpose.
